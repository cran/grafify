Description: Easily explore data by generating different kinds of graphs with few lines of code. Use these ggplot() wrappers to quickly draw graphs of scatter/dots with box-whiskers, violins or SD error bars, data distributions, before-after graphs, factorial ANOVA and more. Customise graphs and choose from 8 colour-blind friendly discreet or 1 continuous colour scheme. Simple code for ANOVA as ordinary (lm()) or mixed-effects linear models (lmer()), including randomised-block or repeated-measures designs. Carry out post-hoc comparisons on fitted models (via emmeans() wrappers). Also includes small datasets for practicing code and teaching basics before users move on to more complex designs.
